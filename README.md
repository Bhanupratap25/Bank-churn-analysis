# Bank-churn-analysis
In the project, we utilized DAX functions, conditional columns, and various transformation tools to manipulate the data effectively. By replacing certain values, we aimed to obtain a clear and insightful visualization. Our main focus was on identifying trends among customers who have churned from the banks, and we diligently searched for any underlying patterns they might be following. Through a combination of diverse charts and tables, we presented a comprehensive analysis of the bank's performance, shedding light on various aspects in an easily understandable manner.
